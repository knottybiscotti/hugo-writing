Hi there!  Wow, thanks for stopping by and taking the time to read this silliness! If you really want to know about me, I guess I'll share a bit. I'm a STEM nerd who really wanted to *also* be a writer. I'm odd and queer and generally okay with that.  I'm ADHD and autistic and I'm good enough at masking that even the people doing my last evaluation commented that they were having a hard time figuring out just how much was learned behaviours.

I'm Canadian and until this year that wasn't a big deal for me but now it's a **HELLA** big deal. I believe womens' rights are human rights, I believe gay rights are human rights, I believe trans rights are human rights and you'll *never* convince me that life is a zero-sum game. My life doesn't get better at the cost of someone else's life getting worse.  A rising tide lifts all boats, and all that.

That's also *not* me over there in the image.  That's my best-girl OC, Keziah Mercer,  and while you won't find any stories about her here (and you probably never will) she's got a rich, complex history and lore about her and if you're curious, hit me up on some of the socials over there in the sidebar.  I love talking about Kez.  She's definitely not me but she's kind of the self-insert I wish I was, I guess.  Goofy, relentlessly optimistic and living her best life every single day.  I'm working on all of those.

Stick around, please! Chat!  Comment!  I promise to leave spicy treats as often as I can, though I'm seriously chaotic so expect this won't be a drip-feed, it'll be total silence followed by a flood of stuff followed by more silence.  That's just how I work.

Be excellent to each other!
