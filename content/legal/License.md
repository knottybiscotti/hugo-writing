* **Share all of it!**  Repost it anywhere you like, print it out and leave it in a coffee shop, take it out into a community town-hall and read it aloud, read it for your own podcast!  It's all good.
* **Create your own stories or art based on it!**  If you want to draw a scene or a character from my writing, go for it!  If you want to write your own derivative work based on it, do that too!  It'd be really cool if you shared it back with me but you don't have to.

If you choose to do any of that stuff above, you **must**:

* Give me proper attribution for my characters, story, whatever.  Just make sure you make it reasonably clear what part of what you're sharing or creating comes from me.
* Allow everyone else to do the same, they can take the stuff that you've shared and they can share it too, make their own art, their own stories, the whole thing. We're sharing!

What you *aren't* allowed to do is:

- You can't sell it and you can't sell the stuff you make that is derived from my work that includes the bits I've created.
- You can't remove my name or copyright from any of my writing.
- You can't pretend you wrote it.
- You can't prevent anyone else from having the same rights, freedoms and obligations described here.

That's all, proper attributions, no commercial use and you have to share.  If you've got any questions about any of this or after reading the full license linked above, just ask!  I almost never bite!
